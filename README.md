# Holiday Managing System

This is a simple holiday managing system to keep track of holidays for years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
The system will let user add holidays if it is not already in the system and remove holidays already in the system.
Users can view holidays in any week of the years, and view weather for upcoming days in the week. 
Users can save current holidays in a json file holiday_list.json.
There is a starting holiday list call starting_holiday_json.json.
There is a text.txt file that hold some of the text displays.
